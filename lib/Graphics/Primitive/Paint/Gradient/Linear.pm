Graphics::Primitive::Paint::Gradient::Linear - Linear color blending

=head1 DESCRIPTION

Graphics::Primitive::Paint::Gradient::Linear is a gradient along a line.

=head1 SYNOPSIS

  use Graphics::Primitive::Paint::Gradient::Linear;

  my $gradient = Graphics::Primitive::Gradient::Linear->new(
      line => Geometry::Primitive::Line->new(
          start => Graphics::Primitive::Point->new(x => 0, y => 0),
          end   => Graphics::Primitive::Point->new(x => 0, y => 10),
      )
  );
  $gradient->add_stop(0.0, $color1);
  $gradient->add_stop(1.0, $color2);
