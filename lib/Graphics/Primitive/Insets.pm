=head1 NAME

Graphics::Primitive::Insets - Space between things

=head1 DESCRIPTION

Graphics::Primitive::Insets represents the amount of space that surrounds
something.  This object can be used to represent either padding or margins
(in the CSS sense, one being inside the bounding box, the other being outside)

=head1 SYNOPSIS

  use Graphics::Primitive::Insets;

  my $insets = Graphics::Primitive::Insets->new({
    top     => 5,
    bottom  => 5,
    left    => 5,
    right   => 5
  });
