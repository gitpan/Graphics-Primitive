=head1 METHODS

=over 4

=item I<component>

Set/Get the component from which to draw layout information.

=item I<height>

Set/Get this layout's height

=item I<slice>

Implemented by role consumer. Given an offset and an optional size, returns a
TextBox containing lines from this layout that come as close to C<$size>
without exceeding it.  This method is provided to allow incremental rendering
of text.  For example, if you have a series of containers 80 units high, you
might write code like this:

  for(my $i = 0; $i < 3; $i++) {
      $textbox = $layout->slice($i * 80, 80);
      # render the text
  }

=item I<width>

Set/Get this layout's width.  Defaults to the width of the component supplied.
