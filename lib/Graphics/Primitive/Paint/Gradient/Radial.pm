Graphics::Primitive::Paint::Gradient::Radial - Radial color blending

=head1 DESCRIPTION

Graphics::Primitive::Paint::Gradient::Radial is a color blend between two
circles.

=head1 SYNOPSIS

  use Graphics::Primitive::Paint::Gradient::Radial;

  my $gradient = Graphics::Primitive::Gradient::Radial->new(
      start => Geometry::Primitive::Circle->new(
          origin => 0, 0,
          radius => 5
      ),
      end => Geometry::Primitive::Circle->new(
          origin => 50, 25,
          radius => 5
      )
  );
  $gradient->add_stop(0.0, $color1);
  $gradient->add_stop(1.0, $color2);
